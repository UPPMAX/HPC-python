```{challenge} Why documenting code?

- **Use the collaborative document**.
- Is project documentation important? Why?
- How would you describe a useful documentation?
- How can you motivate your colleagues to contribute to the documentation?
```

```{solution} Our motivation (but let us brainstorm first)

- You will probably use your code in the future and may forget details.
- You may want others to use your code (almost impossible without documentation).
- You may want others to contribute to the code.
