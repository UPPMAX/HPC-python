how to use LLMs to improve/supplement our coding
really basic course on programming
How to work with data that has 3 or more dimensions. How to treat it and plot results, what plot strategies one can use.
Polars DataFrame together with Pandas would be very interesting
Maybe a course on batch job optimizing
Maybe also more about using R for datascience
