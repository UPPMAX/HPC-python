On Kebnekaise cluster
=====================

.. questions::

   - Can you login to Kebnekaise?
   - Did you try and find Python packages at the system?
   - Can you load Python and start it, as well as run a short program?
   
.. objectives:: 

   - Show how to load Python
   - show how to run Python scripts and start the Python commandline


There are a few things that are different when using Python on the Kebnekaise cluster compared to the UPPMAX clusters: 

- Anaconda/conda/miniconda are NOT recommended and are not supported. You *can* use it, but we generally ask our users to not install Anaconda on our clusters. We recommand that you consider other options like a virtual environment (or a Singularity container, for the most complicated cases). More information here: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/guides/anaconda 
- When loading Python or Python packages, there are prerequisites that needs to be loaded first. See which ones with ``module spider <Python>/<version>`` or ``module spider <Python-package>/<version>`` 
- We have many Python packages site-installed as modules. Some of these are

  - ASE
  - Keras
  - PyTorch
  - SciPy-bundle (Bottleneck, deap, mpi4py, mpmath, numexpr, numpy, pandas, scipy - some of the versions have more)
  - TensorFlow
  - Theano
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - scikit-image
  - pip
  - iPython
  - Cython
  
- We do not currently have Jupyter installed, but there are ways for users to run it. Since it is somewhat involved, please contact us at support@hpc2n.umu.se for more information

Accessing Kebnekaise
--------------------

**Kebnekaise login node**

Login with 

.. code-block:: sh

    ssh <hpc2n-username>@kebnekaise.hpc2n.umu.se
    
using your favourite SSH client. More information about this here: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/access/login 

**Kebnekaise ThinLinc login node**

If you do not have a preferred SSH client installed, then this is the recommended way to login, as it comes with a GUI environment directly and no need to run an X11 server. 

Use 

.. code-block:: sh

    kebnekaise-tl.hpc2n.umu.se
    
as the server in the ThinLinc login. 

There is a guide for you to follow here: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/guides/thinlinc 

Loading Python
--------------

We are going to mainly use Python 3.11.3 for this course, but Python 3.9.5 will be used for some of the GPU and parallel examples. At HPC2N, these modules have the following prerequisites

.. code-block:: sh

   module load GCC/12.3.0 Python/3.11.3

.. code-block:: sh

    module load GCC/10.3.0  Python/3.9.5
    

Starting Python and running Python scripts
------------------------------------------

As mentioned in the general section, you start python with either ``python`` or ``python3`` (assuming it is a version 3.x of Python you are using). 

.. admonition:: Load Python 3.9.5 and start it. You exit with ``exit()``

    .. code-block:: sh

        $ module load GCCcore/10.3.0 Python/3.9.5
        $ python
        Python 3.9.5 (default, Jun  3 2021, 02:53:39) 
        [GCC 10.3.0] on linux
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> exit()


.. admonition:: Try submitting one of the Python programs to the batch system. 

   Remember to change the path in it to the location of your own files! 
   
   .. code-block:: sh

       $ sbatch run_mmmult.sh 
       Submitted batch job 20358127
    
It will create a file named ``slurm-<jobid>.out``. Look at the contents with ``cat`` or ``vi``. 


.. keypoints::

   - You have logged in to Kebnekaise
   - You have loaded Python and tried running a small Python code
