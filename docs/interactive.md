# Interactive work on the compute nodes

There are several ways to run Python interactively

- Directly on the login nodes: **only** do this for short jobs that do not take a lot of resources
- As an interactive job on the computer nodes, launched via the batch system
- Jupyter notebooks (UPPMAX suggests installing your own version with conda)
