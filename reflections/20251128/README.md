## After teaching

I was quite comfortable to start teaching,
as the material was Good Enough. All I needed to add
was the videos for Pelle.

The session went well: all learners were able to achieve the session
goals before the end of the session, which was (1) download
and untar the tarball, (2) load a Python package from a software module
and verify it works.

Because 6 out of 7 learners got to know me from the day before, I cut
some corners, e.g. not ask 'Of the square root of 5, what is the twentieth
digit behind the comma' to bait a 'I do not know' and then me saying 'That
is OK'. I took some extra time at the start with the new learner to get her
into the session.

After the observation of yesterday, I reminded myself to talk a bit
slower during the introduction. At 9:25 the exercises started.
One learner were done at 9:30 (after 5 minutes) minutes,
most finished at around 9:40 (after 15 minutes) and the last
one finished at the time of the break, 9:50 (after 25 minutes).
Hence, the duration of the session is perfect!

I had a one-on-one with most learners. Most had at least one extra question
and there was enough time to discuss this.

## Evaluation results

### Pace

- It was very informative and fun

Unsure if this applies to me.

- a little bit tight

I assume this does not apply to me.

- The time allocated isolated environments and launching IDEs
  from the command line did not seem adequate

Does not apply to me.

- no time for exercise so a bit to fast

I assume this does not apply to me.

### [Future topics](future_topics.txt)

- Me personally I want more about COSMOS-SENS but that is mainly as there
  is very little documentation at Lunarc about it

I agree.

- NO
- More advanced practical management of Conda/virtual environments on HPC,
  Workflow systems like Nextflow or Snakemake

I assume the Conda and venv teachers pick this up.

Unlike Nextflow, Snakemake seems a good fit, as it is intended
to be Python-like.


### [Other comments](comments.txt)

- Exercises were a bit less clear today, which ones we should do and when was a little confusing. Content was very good though :)
- NO
- Because each hpc has different setup it is a bit uninteresting to walk through them all when I'm only concerned with the one I'm using
