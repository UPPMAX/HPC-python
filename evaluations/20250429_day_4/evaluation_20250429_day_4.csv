Hence, another host person, next time, on LLMs (Dr. Jayant) or PINNs (Physics-informed neural network) or other Deep Learnings that are now commonly useful and used, would be very appreciated to see practical applications and implementations of them.","As aforementioned, add practical applications and implementations are the most valuable asset of this course to encourage students and researchers to exploit and explore novel areas out of our research field or comfort zone",

It was hard to see the point of the Machine Learning part and how it should be done or work in the HPC. It was really good to see the final presentation on Dimensionality reduction with examples from someone else, could maybe be done for other topics to introduce us to them with maybe a more dedicated course.",

The section on GPUs, with Brigitte, went smoothly at a nice pace. ML with Jayant also worked well as he took the time to interact with the learners and adapt to how quickly we were able to get through.",Not sure,"LMOD, SLURM, resource monitoring, how to think about and decide upon resource usage","We learn that which we end up doing. Today, in the multiprocessing part, the examples were not working and I did not learn Python multiprocessing - instead I learned a few more things about the module system and had continued failures with Python venvs. On the other hand, in the section on GPUs, the examples were working and I learned very little about using GPUs, but I did learn a few things about SLURM and using Snowy. In order to learn I guess we should have incomplete example code that requires us to type in the crucial parts that we need to be learning. It is nice to do this interspersed in the lecture, for really short/safe bits in the main room and for larger pieces where more discussion results in breakout rooms. Now it seems that we have a couple days worth of exercises still to do, but all the teachers and co-learners are not there anymore. This is not fun. I might add that it is stressful trying to get both a cup of tea and a bathroom break into 15 minutes and there is ZERO margin for overtime when the breaks are that short. Please plan your sessions with more time margins, so that discussions can be had and breaks be accomplished and perhaps even catching up when something did not work right could be possible. Far too often we ended up with no time for exercises - maybe some exercises for later is a good idea, but should in that case be clearly marked as such and the examples that are in the material we really should be able to get hands on with in every session. Right now it seems like I need to go back to almost every session from this course for some reason or the other. Finally, I note that Richel from the first day and Anders from the very end are the two teachers that seemed happy about and interested in the topics that they were teaching. That helps a lot, so that is the right teachers at the right parts.",
