Running Python in batch mode
============================

Any longer, resource-intensive, or parallel jobs must be run through a **batch script**.

The batch system used at both UPPMAX and HPC2N is called SLURM. 

SLURM is an Open Source job scheduler, which provides three key functions

- Keeps track of available system resources
- Enforces local system resource usage and job scheduling policies
- Manages a job queue, distributing work across resources according to policies

In order to run a batch job, you need to create and submit a SLURM submit file (also called a batch submit file, a batch script, or a job script).

**Workflow**

- Write a batch script

  - Inside the batch script you need to load the modules you need (Python, Python packages ... )
  - Possibly activate an isolated/virtual environment to access own-installed packages
  - Ask for resources depending on if it is a parallel job or a serial job, if you need GPUs or not, etc.
  - Give the command(s) to your Python script

- Submit batch script with ``sbatch <my-python-script.sh>`` 

Batch scripts are traditionally prefixed with ``.sh`` or ``.batch``, but it is not necessary. You can name them as you want, as long as you can easily recognize them.
