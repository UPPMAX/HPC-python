Using Python for Machine Learning jobs
======================================

While Python does not run fast, it is still well suited for machine learning. However, it is fairly easy to code in, and this is particularly useful in machine learning where the right solution is rarely known from the start. A lot of tests and experimentation is needed, and the program usually goes through many iterations. In addition, there are a lot of useful libraries written for machine learning in Python, making it a good choice for this area. 

Some of the most used libraries in Python for machine learning are: 

- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

These are all available at UPPMAX and HPC2N. 

In this course we will look at two examples: PyTorch and TensorFlow, and show how you run them at our centres. 

PyTorch
-------

PyTorch has: 

- An n-dimensional Tensor, similar to numpy, but can run on GPUs
- Automatic differentiation for building and training neural networks

The example we will use in this course is taken from the official PyTorch page: https://pytorch.org/ and the problem is of fitting :math:`y=sin‚Å°(x)` with a third order polynomial. The network will have four parameters, and will be trained with gradient descent to fit random data by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the network output and the true output.
