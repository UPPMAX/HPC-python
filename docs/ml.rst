Using Python for Machine Learning jobs
======================================

While Python does not run fast, it is still well suited for machine learning. However, it is fairly easy to code in, and this is particularly useful in machine learning where the right solution is rarely known from the start. A lot of tests and experimentation is needed, and the program usually goes through many iterations. In addition, there are a lot of useful libraries written for machine learning in Python, making it a good choice for this area. 

Some of the most used libraries in Python for machine learning are: 

- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

These are all available at UPPMAX and HPC2N.
