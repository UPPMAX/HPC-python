- Welcome to Anders Hast!
    - AH will add this course to the IntraVis newsletter
    - JY wil on-board AH
    - AH needs to use scatter plots, RP already uses that in her sessions
    - AH would enjoy to see scatter plots of images, but maybe this is not necessary.
      AH will reach out to RP if needed. BB shared
      [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22566284/matplotlib-how-to-plot-images-instead-of-points )
- [RB, decision] Let's decide on the theme we use!
    - Materials:
        - https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/
        - [NAISS File transfer course](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/)
        - Pro: 
            - Deeper table of content
            - Used by some colleagues already
            - Many possible settings
            - CSS could help to make everyone happy (?)
        - Con: 
            - not everybody likes the look
        - Vote: RB
    - ReadTheDocs (style)
        - Example: [Linux-command-line-101 course](https://hpc2n.github.io/linux-command-line-101/)
        - Pro:
        - Con: 
            - not everybody likes the look
            - harder to set up (discussion in matrix)
                - not just to port from sphinx
            - Did not work at Chalmers, but maybe this is caused by they using github or gitlab? as a host. HPC2N use gitea         - Vote:

    - Let's wait what NAISS chooses, may be discussed in the NAISS May meeting, or
      Erik Lindahl picks. Use Sphinx until then
        - [DECIDED!] Vote: BB, RP, JY, BC, PO
- [RB, decision] I'd love to see the markdown version of the website live,
  as to see my progress. When will replace the Sphinx build by a build that
  uses the just-voted-for theme? Let's collect suggestions first,
  after which we vote on all suggestions we like
    - Whenever someone has the time to do so: RB
    - [Other suggestions]
- Course NAISS projects:
    - HPC2N: applied for
    - LUNARC: RP will do this
    - UPPMAX: BC can do (directory name with *uppmax* ending or similar)
    - PDC: BB will do this
    - NSC: BB will do this
- Status on registrations 
    - 7 March 2025:
        - 18 signed up
        - Connecting with
            - Win: 8
            - macOS: 5
            - Linux: 7 (2 also can use Win to connect)
        - Package interest:
            - Pandas: 2
            - scanpy: 1 (single-cell analysis)
            - numpy: 4
            - scipy: 2
            - matplotlib: 2
            - pytorch: 1
            - mph: 1
                - ??Pythonic scripting interface for Comsol Multiphysics
            - scikit-learn: 2
            - xarray: 1
            - dask: 1
            - pint: 1 (manipulate physical quantities)
            - pySCF: 1 (quantum chemistry)
            - "any": 1
        - Linux knowledge:
            - none: 2
            - basic: 11
            - intermediate/some shell scripting: 3
            - Advanced knowledge: 2
        - Python knowledge:
            - none: 2
            - basic: 8
            - intermediate: 4
            - advanced: 4
    - Maybe add interaction with other tools, e.g. links? E.g COMSOL tool
    - Prefer to use/mention generic (as in, not field-specific) Python packages
    - Discuss portability of scripts? E.g. hard-coded Python version in scripts?
        - We cover that already
    - No show `./my_script.py`, it is more a `bash` thing.

Next meeting:

- Wednesday April 2nd 2025 13:00
