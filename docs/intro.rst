    As you probably already know…!
    - “Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
    - It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. 
     - There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. …“

Python at UPPMAX
----------------

The python application at UPPMAX comes with several preinstalled packages.
A very small selection of these are:
Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebook, pip, cython, ipython

.. questions::
    - What to do if you need other packages?
    - How does it work on Bianca without internet?
    - What if I have projects with different requirements in terms of python and packages versions?
    
.. objectives::
    We will:
    - guide through the python ecosystem on UPPMAX
    - look at the package handlers pip and Conda
    - explain how to create isolated environmet 

.. warning:: 
   At UPPMAX we call the applications available via the module system modules.

   To distinguish these modules from the python modules that work as libraries we refer to the later ones as packages.
