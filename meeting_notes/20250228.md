# Planning HPC Python at HPC2N and UPPMAX

## Materials pages

- material: https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python/index.html
- source: https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/tree/main/docs

## Links to Python-Julia-R

- [name=Richel] Can we remove this section?
    - The section mentions another course, irrelevant to this one
    - That other course does not have Python anymore

- [RB, decision, MOVE TO THE FUTURE] Let's decide on the theme we use!
    - Materials:
        - https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/
        - Pro: deeper table of content
        - Con: not everybody likes the look
    - ReadTheDocs (style)
        - Example: [Linux-command-line-101 course](https://hpc2n.github.io/linux-command-line-101/)
        - Pro:
        - Con:
    - [Other suggestions]
- [RB, decision, FUTURE] I'd love to see the markdown version of the website live, as to see my progress. When will replace the Sphinx build by a build that uses the just-voted-for site generator? Let's collect suggestions first, after which we vote on all suggestions we like
    - Whenever someone has the time to do so: RB
    - [Other suggestions]
- FYI, ['Day 1'/'Intro to Python'](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/) course material is done. 
    - It has videos/material for 7 clusters (Alvis, Bianca, COSMOS, Dardel, Kebnekaise, Rackham, Tetralith), such as [login](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/faq/#how-can-i-login-to-an-hpc-cluster), and [loading a module, creating a script, running a Python script](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/sessions/using_the_python_interpreter/). 
        - If you want me to add more clusters, let know (and add me to a project :-) )
    - All communication (i.e. emails sent to participants) in that course -when being stand-alone- can be found [here](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/communication/20250304/). A difference with 'HPC Python' is that all learners of the stand-alone course are requested to apply for a Small Compute project themselves
- FYI, Day 2, hours 1 and 2 (about modules, packages and virtual environments): RB and BC will be co-teaching, inspired by [this paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10074276/) which is the next read in [the NBIS Teaching Literature Club](https://nbisweden.github.io/teaching_literature_club/). Progress is slow, but steady

- Need to discuss Rebecca's parts since she was not here last time?
    - [Day2](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/meeting_notes/20250214.md#day-2): Rebecca takes it
    - [Day3](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/meeting_notes/20250214.md#day-3): Rebecca takes the whole morning
- Anders Hast will talk 10 mins about IntraVis, then about dimensionality reduction techniques, he will bring his own exercise
- Can we settle Day4? Is settled
- We'll invite Anders to attend the next meeting: Jayant will do so :-)
- Onboarding has been scratched
- 'HPC Python' (this course) uses a shared NAISS project (unlike the stand-alone 'Intro to Python' course)
    - LUNARC: Ongoing
        - For ML, there is need for less than 1 GB storage, so that will work :-) (compute projects come with 100 GB storage; only need separate storage project if >100 GB needed)
    - Other centers: done
- We'd enjoy a trainers' project, but that is for Henric Zazzi and Torben Rasmussen to provide for us.
- We need a trainers' project for Rackham. Bj√∂rn will fix that :-)

Next meeting:
    - Friday 7 March 14:00
        - Who is needed? We'll do the things that affect all of us first, them maybe split up :-)
        - R/MATLAB/Julia discussion too
