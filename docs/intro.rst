Python at UPPMAX
----------------

The python application at UPPMAX comes with several preinstalled packages.
A very small selection of these are:
Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebook, pip, cython, ipython

What to do if you need other packages?

.. warning:: 
   At UPPMAX we call the applications available via the module system modules.

   To distinguish these modules from the python modules that work as libraries we refer to the later ones as packages.
