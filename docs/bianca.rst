On Bianca cluster
-----------------

.. questions::

   - What is Bianca?
   - How to install packages on Bianca?
   
.. objectives:: 

   - Overview of pros with CONDA on Bianca
   - Show how to pip install if package is not available from conda

.. Note::

    Bianca has no Internet! ``pip`` will not work!
    
    Since we have mirrored conda repositories locally `conda` will work also on Bianca!


- First try conda, as above.


- If packages are not available, follow the guidelines from the UPPMAX Bianca course:

  - [Packages and libraries to scripting programs](https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshop/intermediate/install/#packages-and-libraries-to-scripting-programs)

  - [Conda on Bianca](https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshop/extra/conda/)

  - [Install with pip on Bianca](https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshop/extra/pip/)



.. keypoints::

   - First try: Conda
   - Second try: pip install or isolated environment moved from Rackham to Bianca via secure transfer
