    Prior questions:
    - What is Pyton?

Why is this course important?
-----------------------------

Python, according to `the TIOBE index <https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/>`__,
is one of the most used programming languages used today.

.. admonition:: What is Python again?
    :class: dropdown

    Python ...

    - is a high-level programming language.
    - is a general-purpose programming language.
    - emphasizes code readability
    - uses indentation to indicate structure
    - is dynamically type-checked
    - supports multiple programming paradigms
    - has a comprehensive standard library
    - has thousands of packages (pieces of re-usable code)
    - has `official documentation <https://www.python.org/doc/>`__
    - has `a forum <https://python-forum.io/>`__

Running Python on an HPC cluster allows scientists to
run their code that needs either (1) massive computation,
(2) massive storage space, and/or (3) storage of sensitive data.

Exercises
---------

Exercise 1: the learning outcomes of today
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this exercise is to find out
what you will learn today.

- Go to `this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfg9jH5RjSAEV_YzxBWcNA0Nd1Oi4--uED0NSnZTDmFAh4CYw/viewform?usp=publish-editor>`__
  and fill it in

    .. _day2-initial-learning-outcomes:

    With this exercise, we'll discover what we'll learn today.

    Give you confidence levels of the following statements,
    using this scale:

    - 0: I don't know even what this is about ...?
    - 1: I have no confidence I can do this
    - 2: I have low confidence I can do this
    - 3: I have some confidence I can do this
    - 4: I have good confidence I can do this
    - 5: I absolutely can do this!

    Give you confidence levels of the following statements below:

    - I can find and load a Python package module
    - I can determine if a Python package is installed
    - I can use an isolated environment
    - I can install Python packages
    - I can write and submit batch job scripts
    - I can use the compute nodes interactively
    - I can use a Python IDE

Exercise 2: downloading and extracting the exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this exercise is to download a file
on your favorite HPC cluster and extract the exercises.

- Go to :ref:`common-use-tarball` and do the procedure.

.. admonition:: **Done?**

    When done, go to the next session and read up on it.

    You can easily navigate there by pressing the 'Next' arrow
    at the bottom of this page, at the right-hand side
