Approaches to Co-Teaching, from `[Cook & Friend, 1995]`:

![Cook & Friend, 1995, figure 1](cook_and_friend_1995_fig.png)

From `[Cook & Friend, 1995]`:

> [...] A first step for most co-teachers is to examine carefully their
> own readiness for the professional and personal demands of
> co-teaching [...]:
>
> - 1. To what extent am I willing to let someone else carry out
>   teaching tasks at which I am particularly skilled?
> - 2. How willing am I to allow a colleague to see aspects of my
>   teaching in which I am not particularly skilled?
> - 3. To what degree do I believe that there is more than one right
>   way to carry out almost any teaching/learning task? 
> - 4. How willing am I to tell a colleague when I disagree about an
>   issue or have a concern?


From `[Cook & Friend, 1995]`, Table 1, 'Questions for Creating a Collaborative
Working Relationship in Co-Teaching':

From `[Sharon, 2014]`:

> - Achieving effective co-teaching relationships is a complex process'
> - Obtaining external dimensions is not enough for effective co-teaching partnerships
> - Teachers can use individual differences as strengths to overcome challenges
> - Compatibility can be achieved through being similar or complementary
> - In an effective co-teaching state, teachers are interdependent of each other

Ironic, the Magiera-Simmons quality indicator model of co-teaching
is not in the academic literature and the website it was at, has moved.

From `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> WaltherThomas (1996) found five common themes that emerged from her research into
> how successful co-teachers use their planning time:
>
> - `1`. Successful co-teachers trust their partners and rely on their partner’s
>   strengths and contributions to facilitate the planning process. 
>   These coteaching partnerships have confidence in each other and delegate
>   responsibilities, knowing that the work will be done.
> - `2`. Successful co-teachers use structured learning environments to help them
>   use their strengths. They use a mix of direct instruction, guided practice,
>   and individual work with teacher assistance in order to support the needs of
>   all learners and ensure both co-teachers are equally involved and valued in
>   the delivering the lesson. Having a structured learning environment to plan
>   for also allows them to focus their planning time on specific types of
>   activities.
> - `3`. Successful co-teachers ensure that both partners’ contributions are valued,
>   both during planning time and during the lesson. There is parity at all
>   levels, effectively erasing the distinction between the general education
>   teacher and the special education teacher.
> - `4`. Successful co-teachers create routines to facilitate their planning. By using
>   their knowledge of each other’s skills, strengths, and styles, in conjunction
>   with planning routines and templates using their limited co-planning time
>   well.
> - `5`. Successful co-teachers become more skilled over time. By combining the
>   qualities listed above and through practice, they find their co-planning time
>   becomes more productive, comfortable and creative as they work at it.


About co-teaching planning templates, from `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> [...] many co-teachers use planning templates [...]. While
> the format of these planning templates varies, they consistently include:
> - Identification of which co-teaching model(s) will be used. This ensures that
>   co-teachers are constantly thinking about how they can use their strengths
>   and the strengths of the various co-teaching models to best meet the needs
>   of their students.
> - Identification of the accommodations and modifications students in the class
>   are eligible for. This ensures that co-teachers can plan activities that take
>   classroom accommodations into consideration. In addition, it ensures that
>   any necessary classroom modifications, for instance in content expectations,
>   are appropriately co-planned for.
> - Identification of the specific teacher roles. This ensures that both teacher’s
>   strengths and skills are taken into account during planning and used in class.
>   By ensuring that both teachers have a specified, active role in the class,
>   coteachers communicate mutual respect and collaboration.

Reflection for co-teachers, from `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

- Do I feel we are jointly planning, both long term and short term?
- Do I believe that I am an equal partner in the decisions that are made?
- Do I feel we have a sense of interdependence?
- Do I feel we are continually learning from each other?
- Do I feel we have clearly defined roles and responsibilities?
- Am I satisfied with our roles and responsibilities?
- Am I learning as a result of our roles and responsibilities?
- Do I feel that information and materials are freely shared?
- Do I feel we communicate effectively?
- Do we regularly reflect on and evaluate our practice?
- Have we discussed various sound, research-based co-teaching models?
- Are we using mutually designed planning tools?
- Do I feel that my knowledge and skills are valued?
- Do I feel I am frequently acknowledged and reinforced by my partner?
- Do I feel my time is used productively when I am in the classroom?
- Can I easily read the nonverbal cues of my partner?
- Do both teachers move freely about the space in the co-taught classroom?
- Do we both often present lessons in the class?
- Are many measures used for grading students?
- Is humor often used in the classroom?
- Are modifications of goals for students with special needs fully incorporated into this class?
- Do we use a variety of classroom management techniques to enhance the learning of all students?
- Am I confident in my partner’s knowledge of the curriculum content?
- Is time allotted or found for common planning?
- Do students accept both teachers as equal partners in the learning process?
- Is behavior management the shared responsibility of both teachers?
- Are grading and other external responsibilities equally shared?

From `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> A template by DeBoer and Fister (1995) asks the teacher to review each of the
> following points to determine if the team is doing all that they can to encourage
> students to think deeply, critically and reflectively in the relevant subject area.
>
> - `1`. Do we ensure that students process information by allowing students to
>   ‘chew on’ the information that is presented so that it makes sense to them
>   and they can see its application to life?
> - `2`. Do we model thinking processes such as problem-solving and
>   decisionmaking by thinking aloud and how we revise our thinking when we have
>   made an error?
> - `3`. Do we ask broad, open-ended questions more frequently
>   than we ask factlevel or yes/no questions?
> - `4`. Do we follow up student responses by probing
>   and asking for clarification,
>   elaboration, evidence, and justification?
> - `5`. Do we have students ask questions of each other and themselves,
>    and make
>   them aware of the different levels of cognition 
>   (from fact-level to higherorder questions)?
> - `6`. Do we wait before calling on students so that they have time to fully
>   process the question and formulate their response?
> - `7`. Do we have a clear, instructional purpose and accomplish it by 
>   planning a sequence of activities that promote active involvement
>   with the content, as
>   well as with peers?
> - `8`. Do we increase metacognition by making students conscious of their own
>   thinking processes?

From `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> As teachers work to develop a co-teaching relationship, it is important to
> consider the following questions:
>
> - Are you flexible or able to compromise your beliefs? 
>   Which one(s) will you not compromise?
> - What skills can you contribute to the co-teaching team that will allow you to
>   be successful?
> - How often should co-teachers reflect on their practice? What are some ways
>   reflection contributes to the co-teaching partnership?
> - How can co-teachers reconcile differences in personal planning styles?
