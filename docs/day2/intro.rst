    Prior questions:
    - What is Pyton?

Why is this course important?
-----------------------------

Python, according to `the TIOBE index <https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/>`__,

.. admonition:: What is Python again?
    :class: dropdown

    Python ...

    - is a high-level programming language.
    - is a general-purpose programming language.
    - emphasizes code readability
    - uses indentation to indicate structure
    - is dynamically type-checked
    - supports multiple programming paradigms
    - has a comprehensive standard library
    - has thousands of packages (pieces of re-usable code)
    - has `official documentation <https://www.python.org/doc/>`__ 
    - has `a forum <https://python-forum.io/>`__

Running Python on an HPC cluster allows scientists to
run their code that needs either (1) massive computation,
(2) massive storage space, and/or (3) storage of sensitive data.
