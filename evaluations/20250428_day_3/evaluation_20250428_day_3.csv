Also, a big caveat in using all these is understanding the documentation/jargon. It would be useful to have that as part of this. As in any other language, you 'd need to refer to the documentation, so it would be good to know how to navigate it. The session where we were typing along was excellent! Very nicely paced, and the message was clear. Also tied together things we worked on last week. Maybe it would be useful to start with a type-along exercise so as people follow an exact example, and then build on that to discuss details. e.g. input + analysis + graph (then discuss types of input, types of analysis and functions, types of graph)",

There are better Python courses elsewhere, without HPC complications - this course might be better with a focus on all the HPC intricacies.",

How to treat it and plot results, what plot strategies one can use.","The pandas section was too fast with too much information, it was hard to follow without being able to try some of the commands. It might be more interesting to be able to try some basic functions and then have access to the documents where there are more examples and commands.",

It is stressing. I'm here to learn, and I do that better in peace. Also, could you please post the recordings a bit faster next time. I saw in the Q/A document that Brigitta lost the recordings for the first day so I am happy that Ricel at least posted them! Would be better to have them in the same youtube list as the rest though",
