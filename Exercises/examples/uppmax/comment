!!! THIS IS NO LONGER NECESSARY !!! 

To fix the OpenMPI problem with the integration2d_mpi.sh : 

Either add to the batch script: 

export OMPI_MCA_pml="^ucx"
export OMPI_MCA_btl_openib_if_include="mlx4_0:1"

or 

--mca opal_common_ucx_opal_mem_hooks 1      # after the mpirun -np -4 

or 

export OMPI_MCA_btl_openib_allow_ib=1


The latter also removes the warnings, so is probably the best choice. 

These worked for me with the modules:

uppmax python/3.11.8 gcc/12.3.0 openmpi/4.1.5

and own-installed mpi4py:

python -m venv --system-site-packages myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
pip install mpi4py
