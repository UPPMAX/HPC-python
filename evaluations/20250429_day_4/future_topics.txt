spend more time on GPU and high performance computing and parallelism on advanced python script such as fourier transform, matrix operaions, differential equations
During last session 15:15 Prof. Anders Hast shared his experience and gave us hints on PCA. Hence, another host person, next time, on LLMs (Dr. Jayant) or PINNs (Physics-informed neural network) or other Deep Learnings that are now commonly useful and used, would be very appreciated to see practical applications and implementations of them.
