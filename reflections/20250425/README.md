My session went reasonably well. I felt tight on time,
and there were 2 technical problems, 
but success rates were high (see below) anyways.

I've seen that a colleague discussed how to get the tarball
in her session. Maybe it should be moved to her session?
Nah, it fit fine within mine. Instead, just remind.

- [ ] Remind colleague that I do the tarball exercise

There was a technical problem: my computer partially froze while
discussing the exercise. Learners said they could still hear
me. As I was nearly done talking, I just said them to work from
this clumsy setting. I gave them 5 minute to work individually
on the exercise. During those 5 minutes, I logged out
and logged in again. All in time! I was happy with this
improvisation.

Due to this, there was another technical problem: my rights
as host were lost. This meant that I could not create breakout rooms.
I improvides: I gave the learner and end time, up until they could
do anything they wanted: I even encouraged them to take off their
headset, as (1) I want them to work undisturbed, and (2) I would
take questions in the main room. This worked out reasonably well.
I was happy again with my improvisation, although it would have been
more fun/useful for the learners to have worked in groups: it
also made me more blind of their progress ... but, hey, it was
the best I could do :-)

In the end, I did ask the progress of the learners:

- 13 out of 13 were able to use a Python module
    - This 1 learner struggled with logging in to Dardel
- 12 out of 14 installed the tarball
    - 1 is the 1 learner above
    - For the other learner is unknown why this did not work.
      I forgot to make a note who this was

Regardless of the hassle, most learners
were able to complete the exercises.

## Other feedback

From the Zoom chat:

> Thanks organising this Richel! Great sessions, and loved the energy.
> The extensive evaluation was from me, as you probably already knew.
> You did such a great work organising the first day,
> and it really shows how dedicated you are at teaching
> and making the sessions student-focused.
> I find it hard to improve when my students give me vague feedback,
> so I thought to pass my 5-cents a bit more constructively in the evaluation.
> Again warm thanks for your great work, it really helped!

I replied:

> Wow, so you were the Super Student! Thanks so much! 
> 
> And thanks for your compliment! There were some flaws, that you can already find in (the draft of) my reflection...
> 
> If you want to discuss teaching, I am always up to it! After the course of course :-)

After which we exchanged emails to talk about teaching.
