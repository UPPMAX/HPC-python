Install packages
================

.. objectives::

    - Learn how to install a (general-purpose) Python package with `pip`
    - Understand limitations of this way, e.g. use cases/best practices

Introduction
------------

There are 2 ways to install missing python packages at a HPC cluster.

- Local installation, always available for the version of Python you had active when doing the installation
    - ``pip install --user [package name]``
- Isolated environment. See next session
    - virtual environents provided by python
    - conda

Normally you want reproducibility and the safe way to go is with isolated environments specific to your different projects.

.. admonition:: Use cases of local general packages

   - Packages, missing in the loaded Python module, that would not be specific for a research project.
   - Comment: You can include the package in a virtual environment as well.
 
Typical workflow
................

1. Load the Python module with correct version.
    - Differs among the clusters

2. Check that the right python is used with ``which python3`` or ``which python``
    - Double check the version ``python3 -V`` or ``python -V``

3. Install with:  ``pip install --user <package-name [version]>`` 

   - Bit more secure (using really the loaded Python): ``python -m pip install --user <package-name [version]>``

Versions
........

- Package name can be pinned, 
   - like ``numpy==1.26.4`` (Note the double ``==``)
   - like ``numpy>1.22``
   - read `more <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#version-specifiers>`_ 

- If not pinned you will get the latest version compatible with the python version you are using.

      ERROR: No matching distribution found for numpy==0.1

   - Try with a version in the list. Not necessary working anyway so trial and error. 

Installation directory
......................

- The package *typically* ends up in ``~/.local/lib/python3.X``
    - Example: Packages installed by both bython version 3.11.5 and 3.11.8 will go into same folder python3.11 and will be seen by both python interpreters. 

Check your installed packages (and dependencies)
................................................

- Check with ``pip list --user``

.. admonition:: Example after just installing ``xarray`` on Tetralith with SciPy-bundle/2023.11 NOT loaded
   :class: dropdown

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pip list --user
      Package         Version
      --------------- -----------
      numpy           2.2.5
      pandas          2.2.3
      python-dateutil 2.9.0.post0
      pytz            2025.2
      six             1.17.0
      tzdata          2025.2
      xarray          2025.4.0

- It is evident that some packages have dependencies! In the example, ``xarray`` also installs ``numpy`` and ``pandas``!

   :class: dropdown

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pip list --user
      Package         Version
      --------------- -----------
      xarray          2025.4.0

- It is also evident that if ``numpy`` and ``pandas`` already are available, those will be used!

Exercise
--------

.. challenge:: (optional) Exercise 1: Install a python package you know of for an old version of Python

   - Load an older Python module (perhaps one you won't use anymore)
   - install the python package (it may already be there but with an older version)
       - (you can always remove your local installation later if you regret it)

   - We may add a solution in a coming instance of the course

   Remember, in order to find out how to load one of the modules, which prerequisites needs to be loaded, as well as which versions are available, use ``module spider <module>`` and ``module spider <module>/<version>``. 

   Often, you also need to load a python module, except in the cases where it is included in ``python`` or ``python_ML_packages`` at UPPMAX or with ``SciPy-bundle`` at HPC2N. 

   NOTE that not all versions of Python will have all the above packages installed!
