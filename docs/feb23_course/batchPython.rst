Running Python in batch mode
============================

.. questions::

   - What is a batch job?
   - How to make a batch job?



.. objectives::

   - Short introduction to SLURM scheduler
   - Show structure of a batch script
   - Try example


Any longer, resource-intensive, or parallel jobs must be run through a **batch script**.

The batch system used at both UPPMAX and HPC2N is called SLURM.

SLURM is an Open Source job scheduler, which provides three key functions

- Keeps track of available system resources
- Enforces local system resource usage and job scheduling policies
- Manages a job queue, distributing work across resources according to policies

In order to run a batch job, you need to create and submit a SLURM submit file (also called a batch submit file, a batch script, or a job script).

Guides and documentation at: http://www.hpc2n.umu.se/support and https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/slurm-user-guide/

**Workflow**

- Write a batch script

  - Inside the batch script you need to load the modules you need (Python, Python packages ... )
  - Possibly activate an isolated/virtual environment to access own-installed packages
  - Ask for resources depending on if it is a parallel job or a serial job, if you need GPUs or not, etc.
  - Give the command(s) to your Python script

- Submit batch script with ``sbatch <my-python-script.sh>``

Common file extensions for batch scripts are ``.sh`` or ``.batch``, but they are not necessary. You can choose any name that makes sense to you.

Useful commands to the batch system
-----------------------------------

- Submit job: ``sbatch <jobscript.sh>``
- Get list of your jobs: ``squeue -u <username>``
- Check on a specific job: ``scontrol show job <job-id>``
- Delete a specific job: ``scancel <job-id>``
- Useful info about a job: ``sacct -l -j <job-id> | less -S``
- Url to a page with info about the job (Kebnekaise only): ``job-usage <job-id>``

.. tip::

   - For parallel computing, you may get an introduction here: (https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python/parallel.html)



.. keypoints::

   - The SLURM scheduler handles allocations to the calculation nodes
   - Batch jobs runs without interaction with user
   - A batch script consists of a part with SLURM parameters describing the allocation and a second part describing the actual work within the job, for instance one or several Python scripts.

      - Remember to include possible input arguments to the Python script in the batch script.
