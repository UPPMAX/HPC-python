#### Schedule

##### Day 2

- [Schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/docs/schedule.rst#day-2-packages-and-basic-analysis)

- We decided to have more time for packages (either taken from first hour or continuing after 11.
-What does this mean: "Loading Analysis SW? Envs?"": moot session, fill with more IDEs?
- Batch jobs are really supposed to be on this day, but when? after IDEs or directly?
- Exact timings

- Slurm 45
- interactive 45
    - from terminal
    - CPU/GPU terminal on demand
- IDEs1: starting only 45
    - demos+instructions 30
    - exercise 15 m
- IDEs2: using 45
    - theory about different IDEs plus 
    - some demoing
    - using environments
    - exercises
        - script



##### Day 3
- [Schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/docs/schedule.rst#day-2-packages-and-basic-analysis)

- batch jobs
- Exact timings
- Any comments?


##### Day 4
- [Schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/docs/schedule.rst#day-4-parallelism-gpus-and-machine-learning)

- Are we fine with 2 x 50m parallelism and 3.5 x 50m of ML?
   PO: yes, from my side
- GPU introduction
- Exact timings
- Any comments?

PO: For the Parallelism session, I want to change the questions in the evaluation:

"I can start a script that uses parallel code" -> "I know the basics of the different parallelization tools in Python"

"I can measure the effect of using more nodes for parallel code" -> "I know how a simple for loop can be parallelized with Multiprocessing and how it can run on multiple cores"

#### Admin
- Course projects
    - numbers
    - local
- Registered
    - do we ask for which day? (add in future?)
- Lower limit?
    - BC: related to number of course hours? 3(4) x 6 hrs = 18(24) hrs
        - ALT: count on daily basis
    - If lower than 50%(?) one week before, cancel?

#### New clusters

- Pelle!
    - Ask Björn if you need help
- Berzelius?
    - Björn just got access...
    - Peter Münger has now added the default allocation on Berzelius to the NAISS support staff project NAISS 2025/22-395 (Project Title: Test allocation for access for NAISS support staff).
