Overall a good setup of the course! It is hard to do the excersices because environments etc. has to be set, so I will have to go back later to finish.
The first half of today’s training covered important material, but I personally found the delivery less engaging. It felt more like a reading of the manual, and I didn’t gain much from it. Demonstrating everything with actual code and a more hands-on approach would be essential to better understand the core concepts. The second half of the training, however, was satisfactory.
