Took three hours to explain Python and virtual environment. Python things should have been prerequisite.,Please be prepared and make it more hands-on. ,"Nothing. This is very poorly organized.

I like it that you can test each step, and if you have problems with any step, you have a solution file so that you don't fall behind.","I think that too much time was invested into how to handle environments and the first half of the workshop. This first half was not specifically HPC in Python, but how to handle environments.",Announcement and registration was extremely good.,I would like to see a course bridging basic and more advanced deep learning topics.
