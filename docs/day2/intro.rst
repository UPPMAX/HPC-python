    Prior questions:
    - What is Pyton?

Why is this course important?
-----------------------------

Python, according to `the TIOBE index <https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/>`__,
is one of the most used programming languages used today.

.. admonition:: What is Python again?
    :class: dropdown

    Python ...

    - is a high-level programming language.
    - is a general-purpose programming language.
    - emphasizes code readability
    - uses indentation to indicate structure
    - is dynamically type-checked
    - supports multiple programming paradigms
    - has a comprehensive standard library
    - has thousands of packages (pieces of re-usable code)
    - has `official documentation <https://www.python.org/doc/>`__
    - has `a forum <https://python-forum.io/>`__

Running Python on an HPC cluster allows scientists to
run their code that needs either (1) massive computation,
(2) massive storage space, and/or (3) storage of sensitive data.

Exercises
---------

Exercise 1: the learning outcomes of today
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this exercise is to find out
what you will learn today.

- Go to `this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWUw99NWVgMzUwNOOitUCRx308fdqrM3bb2yMT6vvaa0s-1Q/viewform?usp=header>`__
  and fill it in

    .. _day2-initial-learning-outcomes:

    With this exercise, we'll discover what we'll learn today.

    Give you confidence levels of the following statements,
    using this scale:

    - 0: I don't know even what this is about ...?
    - 1: I have no confidence I can do this
    - 2: I have low confidence I can do this
    - 3: I have some confidence I can do this
    - 4: I have good confidence I can do this
    - 5: I absolutely can do this!

    Give you confidence levels of the following statements below:

    - I can find and load a Python package module
    - I can determine if a Python package is installed
    - I can use an isolated environment
    - I can install Python packages
    - I can write and submit batch job scripts
    - I can use the compute nodes interactively
    - I can use a Python IDE
    - I can create plots in ``matplotlib``

Exercise 2: downloading and extracting the exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this exercise is to download a file
on your favorite HPC cluster and extract the exercises.

- Go to :ref:`common-use-tarball` and do the procedure.

.. admonition:: **Done?**

    When done, go to the next session and read up on it.
