# Info about the exercise and demo dir

The directories below "examples" contains:

- programs: Python codes, mainly, as well as a few Fortran and Julia codes
- hpc2n: Batch scripts that can run on Kebnekaise when you have edited the MYPATH variable inside (since the Python scripts recides in the programs directory)
- uppmax: same as above, but for UPPMAX (Rackham mainly)
