What is python?
---------------

As you probably already know…

    - “Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
    - It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing.
    - There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. …“

In particular, what sets Python apart from other languages is its fantastic
open-source ecosystem for scientific computing and machine learning with
libraries like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn and Pytorch.

- Official Python documentation is found here https://www.python.org/doc/ .
- Python forum is found here https://python-forum.io/ .
- A nice introduction to packages can be found here: https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/dependencies/
- CodeRefinery develops and maintains training material on software best practices for researchers that already write code. Ther material addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as programming language-independent as possible. https://coderefinery.org/lessons/
- The youtube video `Thinking about Concurrency <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv25Dwe84g0>`_ is a good introduction to writing concurrent programs in Python
- The book `High Performance Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/>`_ is a good resource for ways of speeding up Python code.


.. objectives::

    We will:

    - Teach you how to navigate the module system at UPPMAX (and HPC2N)
    - Show you how to find out which versions of Python and packages are installed
    - Look at the package handler **pip** (and **Conda** for UPPMAX)
    - Explain how to create and use virtual environments
    - Show you how to run batch jobs
    - Show some examples with parallel computing and using GPUs
