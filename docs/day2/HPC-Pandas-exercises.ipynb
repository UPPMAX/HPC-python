    "Here you can test your comprehension of the Pandas introductory material. As with most coding packages, it is more important that you understand enough to know what to look for if you get stuck than it is to actually memorize all the methods, attributes, and syntax. You are welcome to consult the lecture material and/or the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html) whenever you want.\n",
