# Running Jupyter on compute nodes

```{callout} What is Jupyter?
  - "The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience."
    - Run python interactively and make a "story" document with text and code and figures woven together. 
    - Includes file manager
  - You run it in a **web browser** (``firefox`` at UPPMAX)

  - The Jupyter project site contains a lot of information and inspiration. <https://jupyter.org/>
  - The Jupyter Notebook documentation. <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>
```


## On the compute nodes

## 1. Start an interactive session from the login node
``` bash
# For Rackham
$ interactive -A snic-project  -t 4:00:00

# For Snowy
$ interactive -M snowy -A snic-project  -t 4:00:00
```

## 2. Start jupyter notebook from the interactive session (*when it gets allocated*)
``` bash
$ module load python/3.9.5
$ jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

## 3. Connect to the running notebook 
Keep this session open and running. Note the node on which you are got the interactive job i.e. something like "r141".

- If you are connected to Rackham via [Thinlinc session](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/thinlinc-graphical-connection-guide/), open a browser with the link you got but modified to point to r141 i.e. 
http://r141:8888/?token=5c3aeee9fbfc75f7a11c4a64b2b5b7ec49622231388241c2
- If you use ssh to connect to Rackham, you need to forward the port of the interactive node to your local computer.
    - On Linux or Mac this is done by running in another terminal. Make sure you have the ports changed if they are not at the default 8888.
        ``` bash
        $ ssh -L 8888:r141:8888 username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
        ```
    - If you use PuTTY - you need to change the settings in "Tunnels" accordingly (could be done for the current connection as well).

    On your computer open  the address you got but replace r141 with localhost i.e. 
http://localhost:8888/?token=5c3aeee9fbfc75f7a11c4a64b2b5b7ec49622231388241c2

    This should bring the jupyter interface on your computer and all calculations and files will be on Rackham.
