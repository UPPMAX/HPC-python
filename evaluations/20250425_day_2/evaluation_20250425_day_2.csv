However the resources provided are sufficient to catch up if we were stuck anywhere. ,Yes,More information on the HPC environment within a similar context. Maybe focusing on one HPC centre at a time. ,"Overall, a great session, but it would be great to have more time plannned into each session for questions. ",

",Not sure,Topics are ok. Just give more profound and practical demos during the sessions.,For the matplotlib part: to improve more demonstrations rather than read so quickly the content to accomplish the schedule. Improve the depth of the course not too superficial to at least catch some key points that helps to start.  The morning session had better demo and I could follow the steps.,

What to do when the default modules are not enough.","The written material is quite good and shows the different options, but simply going through them during the course takes too long and sometimes end up with focus on specific HPC systems that not everyone is going to use. There are instructions for each cluster, so maybe the topics should be more generic with access to the specific info as needed. The IDE section, for example, could only show how to do it to very specific cases, while having the cluster instructions and a generic discussion about the options could be better.",

I know enough about Python, I do not know enough about the software module system and SLURM and any other HPC-specific stuff.",Not sure,,"(did not attend Matplotlib part) 1. Overall the reading/presentation material was good to very good, just too far between exercises - as soon as one step has been explained, I want to test it and make sure I can do it! But some information was outdated and some part or parts had lots of spelling errors.  2. Again and again, there was not enough time margins within each session. Asking us to do stuff on the breaks is BAD. Breaks are needed for food, toilet and looking away from the screen. Can't learn anything if we don't get breaks.  3. Lunch break start and end time needs to be confirmed before 12:00. For those of us caught up in listening and following along it got cut much too short today.",
