- Day 2
- Date: 2025-04-25
- Author: Richel

My session went reasonably well. I felt tight on time,
and there were 2 technical problems, 
but success rates were high (see below) anyways.

I've seen that a colleague discussed how to get the tarball
in her session. Maybe it should be moved to her session?
Nah, it fit fine within mine. Instead, just remind.

- [ ] Remind colleague that I do the tarball exercise

There was a technical problem: my computer partially froze while
discussing the exercise. Learners said they could still hear
me. As I was nearly done talking, I just said them to work from
this clumsy setting. I gave them 5 minute to work individually
on the exercise. During those 5 minutes, I logged out
and logged in again. All in time! I was happy with this
improvisation.

Due to this, there was another technical problem: my rights
as host were lost. This meant that I could not create breakout rooms.
I improvised: I gave the learner and end time, up until they could
do anything they wanted: I even encouraged them to take off their
headset, as (1) I want them to work undisturbed, and (2) I would
take questions in the main room. This worked out reasonably well.
I was happy again with my improvisation, although it would have been
more fun/useful for the learners to have worked in groups: it
also made me more blind of their progress ... but, hey, it was
the best I could do :-)

In the end, I did ask the progress of the learners:

- 13 out of 13 were able to use a Python module
    - This 1 learner struggled with logging in to Dardel
- 12 out of 14 installed the tarball
    - 1 is the 1 learner above
    - For the other learner is unknown why this did not work.
      I forgot to make a note who this was

Regardless of the hassle, most learners
were able to complete the exercises.

I think the camera recordings do more harm than good,
as it kills interactivity during class, at the minimal gain
of people outside of class being able to see these recording:

- Using live recordings as a supplementary tool may not be worth it in our settings,
  as 'No performance advantage was found for viewing recordings despite students'
  positive perception of their utility.'
  [Lesser, Melissa, and Lora Packel. "Educational Lessons from a Pandemic: 
  Lecture Recording and Learning Outcomes." 
  Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice 22.2 (2024): 9., 
  [Link to paper](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/ijahsp/vol22/iss2/9/)]
- 'The main finding is that students using the online lectures 
  as a substitute for attending lectures are ultimately 
  at a fairly severe disadvantage in terms of their final marks'
  [Williams, Andrew, Elisa Birch, and Phil Hancock. "The impact of online lecture recordings on student performance."
  Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 28.2 (2012), 
  [Link to paper](https://ajet.org.au/index.php/AJET/article/view/869)].
- I found most experimental papers do not compare with live recording (it
  is usual pre-recorded versus an unrecorded/live lesson).
  The exception is a paper that does recommend the recording live webinars,
  although it admits that 
  '[Webinars tend] to be less engaging and less interactive for the participant'
  [Dailey-Hebert, Amber. "Maximizing interactivity in online learning: 
  Moving beyond discussion boards." Journal of Educators Online 15.3 (2018): n3.,
  [paper](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1199230)].

- [x] Suggest this in a meeting

For the course as a whole, think following the
  pedagogic literature has a bigger impact over reading evaluations.

- For example 'long lectures and presentations will fail because students stop viewing and listening
  after about six minutes'
  [Nilson, Linda B., and Ludwika A. Goodson. Online teaching at its best: 
  Merging instructional design with teaching and learning research. John Wiley & Sons, 2021].
  From the same book, the 25 principes of learning from cognitive science (chapter 4, page 92)
  gives some great pointers, e.g. '2. Students learn [...] better [...] by engaging in an activity
  than when they passively watch [...] an instructor', 
  '6. Some qualities [...] help students learn [...] better [...]: human faces, [...] instructor enthusiasm'.

### [Pace](../../evaluations/20250425_day_2/pace.txt)

- the pacing was good. I really liked the course material.
- Fast on the second day

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises.

- great
- I think it was good, I could keep up and take notes during all of the lectures.
- I feel like it was a bit rushed, good content but a bit too much given
  the amount of time maybe?

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises.

- It was a lot of information to take in.
  However the resources provided are sufficient to catch up if we were
  stuck anywhere.
- Good
- It was the right pace
- I did not feel comfortable during the afternoon session was running too fast,
  just to adjust to the schedule and got few from that and was confused
  because of several concepts in a bunch without explain the practical examples
  I guess it is been assumed that everybody knows all the concepts.

Not my session.

- Too fast to combine explanations and exercises

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises.

- Good pace considering the amount of materials and time.
  Then one needs to practise home by rewatching the YT videos

Hmmm, in general, I find that live recordings have
'No performance advantage was found for viewing recordings despite students'
positive perception of their utility.'
[Lesser, Melissa, and Lora Packel. "Educational Lessons from a Pandemic: 
Lecture Recording and Learning Outcomes." 
Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice 22.2 (2024): 9., 
[Link to paper](https://nsuworks.nova.edu/ijahsp/vol22/iss2/9/)].
However, that paper does find positive effects for learners that, like
here, use it after attending a session.

- Inconsistent - seemed slow much of the time, while some parts passed by
  before they could be properly explained or understood: it seemed to me that
  the time was not spent on the right things. I know enough about Python,
  I do not know enough about the software module system and SLURM
  and any other HPC-specific stuff.

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises.

However, I will suggest to do more foundational things at Day 2

- [x] Suggest to do more foundational things at Day 2 in a meeting

- Too fast

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises.

- okish
- Suitable

### [Future topics](../../evaluations/20250425_day_2/future_topics.txt)

- Xarray and dask
- it is totally enough for me to study this content, and the document is great,
  I can read the document to revise the lesson
- It could be helpful to have a lecture about R as well.

I don't think R should be part of a Python course.
But hey, I can link to it

- [x] Link to R course

- More information on the HPC environment within a similar context.
  Maybe focusing on one HPC centre at a time.
- Topics are ok. Just give more profound and practical demos during the
  sessions.

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises.

- A summary of options in using Python in the HPC, with suggestions and best
  practices. What to do when the default modules are not enough.

The 'Install packages' session should cover that.

- This 2nd day and we have not going through ML and Deep learning PyTorch and
  Tensorflow GPU: PINNs, Quantum ML (PennyLane, Qiskit) or small LLM

Sure, we do that on Day 4.

- matplotlib from a regular shell/interactive/in compute jobs

- How to find compatible modules and packages

We could add this indeed.

- [x] Suggest this in a meeting

### [Other comments](comments.txt)

- every thing is great for me

Great!

- I think all of the training materials were very clear, and I liked the amount
  of hands-on exercises. I also really appreciated how supportive all of the
  teachers were, the classes had a very nice atmosphere.

Great!

- Overall, a great session, but it would be great to have more time plannned
  into each session for questions.

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises and questions.

- For the matplotlib part: to improve more demonstrations rather than read so
  quickly the content to accomplish the schedule.
  Improve the depth of the course not too superficial to at least catch
  some key points that helps to start.
  The morning session had better demo and I could follow the steps.

Great!

- The written material is quite good and shows the different options,
  but simply going through them during the course takes too long and
  sometimes end up with focus on specific HPC systems that not everyone
  is going to use. There are instructions for each cluster, so maybe the
  topics should be more generic with access to the specific info as needed.
  The IDE section, for example, could only show how to do it to very specific
  cases, while having the cluster instructions and a generic discussion about
  the options could be better.

I assume the 'focus on specific HPC systems that not everyone is going to use'
does not apply to me: I directly start from the cluster-specific
documentation.

- Overall very good docs from each mentors that states pro and contro and
  niche details of each HPC. Infinite for trouble-shooting support especially
  for beginners

Great!

- (did not attend Matplotlib part) 1. Overall the reading/presentation material
  was good to very good, just too far between exercises - as soon as one step
  has been explained, I want to test it and make sure I can do it!
  But some information was outdated and some part or parts had lots of
  spelling errors. 2. Again and again, there was not enough time margins within
  each session. Asking us to do stuff on the breaks is BAD.
  Breaks are needed for food, toilet and looking away from the screen.
  Can't learn anything if we don't get breaks. 3. Lunch break
  start and end time needs to be confirmed before 12:00.
  For those of us caught up in listening and following along it
  got cut much too short today.

Fun that the spelling errors are mentiond!

- [x] Mentioned this in a meeting

Indeed, the breaks were not respected.

- [x] Mentioned this in a meeting

- It's good that you record, but could you post the recordings a bit faster
  so we can go through before the rest of the course?

I assume this does not apply to me, as my recordings are in my course
material.

- Not fond of the IDEs, I think it's unnecessarily cumbersome.
  Shell is much easier to work in.
  You don't have to load a lot of other things, set graphics and fight with
  it :( Why this focus on jupyter or spyder or whatever it was called

I agree that not everyone needs an IDE. However, Jupyter was needed
to be able to do the exercises by Anders Hast.

I agree: I liked Anders' lecture too! Even though there were 6
minutes of exercises (on the YouTube video: 28:47-34:02), I do think
this is worth it.

I think this will be solved when more exercises are done.

I agree.

I think I already do this, as I've checked my course material
by actually testing this by recording.

I assume this is not about my session, as 60% of its time there
was time for exercises and questions.

I agree that we should test if our learners got it.

I hope I do this

I hope the latter applies to my sessions, as there was enough time
for exercises.

## Focus and structure

> This course teaches many separate things. This gets a bit too messy,

> the entirety of this and will not be able to group and separate things—and
> for the learners who only needs selected parts of the course.

> It would be easier for both groups (though a bit less efficient,
> for those who both need all of it and are somehow able to efficiently learn
> it the way it is now) if this content was divided between as much as
> four separate courses:

> - Intro to HPC, usage and management of software and code 
>   (Logging in, LMOD, SLURM; the things that are actually different
>   between HPC and a single-user single computer)
> - Intro to Python (this already exists and is day 1)
> - Python coding for big computation, big data and AI (this includes parallell
>   and GPU but is not specific to HPC and probably exists elsewhere)
> - Using Python code, packages and environments at NAISS HPC systems
>   (LMOD, venv, conda; when to use what and how they interact)

> Course 1 is general to HPC users, not specific to Python.
> It should probably be provided by NAISS quite often
> and be a prerequisite to all other NAISS courses.
> Courses 2 and 3 are general to Python users,
> not specific to HPC, widely available from elsewhere.
> Course 4 is specific to Python in HPC;
> this is what I, a seasoned learner,
> would expect NAISS to provide in regards to using Python.

I enjoy this suggested schedule. I know that 'Intro to Python' will get more
HPC-ey, among others by adding how to loading Python package modules.
I feel that is a first step to what the learner wants/needs.

## What I expected (or hoped) to learn that I did not learn

> Essentially the fourth course mentioned above. I have not acquired the one
> skill (AFAIK) that is truly specific to Python on HPC: how to choose how to
> manage the packages.
> Everything else (that was in this course) is shared with
> either other HPC users or other Python users—therefore it is discussed and
> taught by other resources—so this is what I truly wanted from this course.
> I did learn a bit about it but it seemed to happen by accident as much or
> more than as a result of the course truly focussing on this matter.

> The fix would be to make sure every single command that loads a module or
> a python package does specify a specific version.
> Well, for the recurring problem that I do remember,
> but there may have been more problems.

As far as I know, my course material has explicit versions.

## Some other feedback

From [Day 3](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/20250428_day_3/comments.txt#L6):

> This is mostly for the parts last week, 
> I'm not so fond of this calling out of people with their names.
> It is stressing.
> I'm here to learn, and I do that better in peace. 

I assume this applies to me, and maybe to other colleagues as well.
It is too bad that 16.1% (in range 6.1-25%) of the Swedish population,
has social anxiety, although 'Subjects with social phobia who do find their
way into the university could be described as having predominantly a
mild form of the disorder' [Tillfors, Maria, and Tomas Furmark.
"Social phobia in Swedish university students: prevalence, subgroups and
avoidant behavior." Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology
42 (2007): 79-86.][Link](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F070674370404900910).
The effect of this is unknown, as here I quote the paper:
'future studies should investigate whether sufferers of
social phobia underachieve or abolish their studies prematurely.'.
The main solutions given in that paper is
'It is an important task to inform students with social phobia that effective
pharmacological and psychosocial treatments are available.'

I will keep doing this, as asking people randomly is most effective
(where raising hands is least effective)
[Bell, Mike. The fundamentals of teaching: A five-step model to put the
research evidence into practice. Routledge, 2020, pages 128-129].
However, I do introduce that I will ask people randomly, giving people
with social anxiety a way out (by turning off the camera) and demonstrating
that an incorrect answer or a 'I don't know' is fine too.
So, I agree with the learners, yet his/her
solution is not the one I will follow.

> Also, could you please post the recordings a bit faster next time.
> I saw in the Q/A document that Brigitta lost the recordings for the first day
> so I am happy that Richel at least posted them!
> Would be better to have them in the same youtube list as the rest though

I think this is a bit harsh on Brigitte. 
Instead of uploading the video twice, it can be linked to from different
playlists.
Alternatively, what about we put the playlist on the website?

- [x] Suggest to do so in a meeting

## Meeting notes

```
Below are the meeting notes of 2025-05-22 with my suggestions.
```

- [Jayant] More InfraVis like collabs demoing usecases
    - [Richel] I agree we should collaborate more!
- [Richel] From the learners, I read [a suggestion to make day 2 'Intro to HPC, usage and management of software and code'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L47) and ['it seemed to me that the time was not spent on the right things'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/20250425_day_2/pace.txt#L12). What about we listen to that? In practice,
  I feel this can mean either
  - switching 'matplotlib' on Day 2 with 'Slurm and batch jobs' on Day 3
  - move 'matplotlib' on Day 2 for more time for the more foundational things (Install packages, Slurm, isolated environments)
- [Richel] From the learners I read the suggested topic ['How to find compatible modules and packages'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/20250425_day_2/future_topics.txt#L9).
  That this would be useful is also mentioned by this learner
  ['Learning about modules and packages and handling the dependency hell in various ways is very good'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L19)
  I think it is great idea to add more time for getting modules to work.
  What about we add it? On the other hand, one learner stated 
  ['The fix would be to make sure every single command that loads a module or a python package does specify a specific version'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L57), which would mean to make the course material more version-explicit. I am up for both!
      - Add more time for getting modules to work: RB
      - Make all course material version specific: RB
      - Make no changes:
- [Richel] One learner mentioned ['some part or parts had lots of spelling errors'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/20250425_day_2/comments.txt#L7). I hope the spell checker (we can get it to
  work when using markdown) will fix that
- [Richel] One learner mentioned ['Asking us to do stuff on the breaks is BAD'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/20250425_day_2/comments.txt#L7). What about we stick to our scheduled breaks?
    - Follow the breaks as in the schedule: RB
    - Ignore breaks:
- [Richel] A learner stated ['Anders Hast deserves special mention for bringing true researcher enthusiasm, it is great to learn from teachers that know and enjoy the subject at hand like that'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L11). Could we give Anders more time for his exercise? Now there were only 6 minutes of exercises (on the YouTube video: 28:47-34:02)
    - Give Anders more time: RB
    - Keep the current schedule:
- [Richel] A learner [exercises should be part of the course under course time](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L25),
  with the problem that ['we might not get knowledge/skill presumed by later parts of the course'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L27).
  What about we give our learners the time to do exercises, as well as test if indeed they were able to do so?
  Adding more time for a session seems fine be my.
    - Add more time for exercises and make sure they are ready for future sessions: RB
    - Ask learners to work during the breaks or evenings:
- [Richel] A learner stated ['The session on IDEs had barely enough time for me to get Jupyter running, while I would've expected to try VS Code and Spyder as well since all of them are in there'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L29).
  What about we give this session more time?
    - Give IDEs more time: RB
    - Only do Jupyter: RB
    - Keep the schedule as it is:
- [Richel] A learner suggested [a 4 day schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/202504_course/evaluation_202504_full_course.md?plain=1#L47).
  I know that 'Intro to Python' will get more HPC-ey, among others by adding how to loading
  Python package modules.
- [Richel] A learners suggested ['could you please post the recordings a bit faster next time'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/20250428_day_3/comments.txt#L6)
  and ['would be better to have them in the same youtube list as the rest though'](https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python/blob/main/evaluations/20250428_day_3/comments.txt#L6). I think the first is a bit harsh.
  The second is doable: just add the existing video to the HPC2N playlist (i.e you can do
  that in YouTube).
    - Link to videos in YouTube playlist: RB
    - Upload videos twice:
  Alternatively, we can put the videos in a table on the website too.
    - Add a table on the website with all link: RB
    - Rely on the YouTube playlists only:
