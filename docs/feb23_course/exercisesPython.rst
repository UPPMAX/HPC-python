Exercises
=========


Isolated
--------

.. challenge:: Create a virtual environment with a requirements file below

   - Create a virtual environment with python-3.8.X (check what is available on your cluster) with the name ``analysis``.
   - Install packages defined by the ``requirements.txt`` file (save it).

   .. code-block:: sh

      numpy==1.18.1
      matplotlib==3.1.3
      pandas==1.1.2

   - Check that the packages were installed.
   - Don't forget to deactivate afterwards.

     .. code-block:: sh

          $ module load python/3.8.7
          $ python -m venv --system-site-packages /proj/py-r-jl/<user>/python/analysis

      Activate it.

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ source /proj/py-r-jl/<user>/python/analysis/bin/activate

      - Note that your prompt is changing to start with (analysis) to show that you are within an environment.
      - Install the packages from the file::

        pip install -r requirements.txt

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ pip list
	 $ deactivate

    :class: dropdown

     .. code-block:: sh

          $ module load GCC/10.2.0 Python/3.8.6
          $ virtualenv --system-site-packages /proj/nobackup/your-project-id/analysis

      Activate it.

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ source /proj/nobackup/your-project-id/analysis/bin/activate

      - Note that your prompt is changing to start with (analysis) to show that you are within an environment.
      - Install the packages from the file::

        pip install -r requirements.txt

      .. code-block:: sh

         $ pip list
	 $ deactivate



Conda (UPPMAX)
--------------

.. challenge:: UPPMAX: Create a conda environment and install some packages

   - Be sure to deactivate any virtual environment.
   - First check the current installed packages while having ``python/3.9.5`` loaded
   - Open a new terminal and have the old one available for later comparison
   - Use the conda module on Rackham and create an environment with name ``HPC-python23`` with ``python 3.7``  and ``numpy 1.15``

   	- Use your a path for ``CONDA_ENVS_PATH`` of your own choice or ``/proj/py-r-jl/<user>/python``
        - (It may take a minute or so)

   - Activate!
   - Check with ``pip list`` what is there. Compare with the environment given from the python module in the first terminal window.

   	- Which version of Python did you get?

   - Don't forget to deactivate the Conda environment before doing other exercises!

          Write this in the terminal

          .. code-block:: sh

            $ module load conda
            $ export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=/proj/py-r-jl/<user>/python
            $ conda create --name HPC-python23 python=3.7 numpy=1.15
            $ source activate HPC-python23
            $ pip list
            $ python -V
            $ source deactivate

Batch
-----

.. challenge:: Run the first serial example script from further up on the page for this short Python code (sum-2args.py)

    .. code-block:: python

        import sys

        x = int(sys.argv[1])
        y = int(sys.argv[2])

        sum = x + y

        print("The sum of the two numbers is: {0}".format(sum))

    Remember to give the two arguments to the program in the batch script.
