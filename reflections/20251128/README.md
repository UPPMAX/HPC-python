## After teaching

I was quite comfortable to start teaching,
as the material was Good Enough. All I needed to add
was the videos for Pelle.

The session went well: all learners were able to achieve the session
goals before the end of the session, which was (1) download
and untar the tarbal, (2) load a Python package from a software module
and verify it works.

Because 6 out of 7 learners got to know me from the day before, I cut
some corners, e.g. not ask 'Of the square root of 5, what is the twentieth
digit behind the comma' to bait a 'I do not know' and then me saying 'That
is OK'. I took some extra time at the start with the new learner to get her
into the session.

After the observation of yesterday, I reminded myself to talk a bit
slower during the introduction. At 9:25 the exercises started.
One learner were done at 9:30 (after 5 minutes) minutes,
most finished at around 9:40 (after 15 minutes) and the last
one finished at the time of the break, 9:50 (after 25 minutes).
Hence, the duration of the session is perfect!

I had a one-on-one with most learners. Most had at least one extra question
and there was enough time to discuss this.
