Status 'Packages':

- Current material can be found `[dead link]`
  and is made by Björn
- [ ] Suggest co-teaching there too?

Status 'Isolated environment':

- Current material can be found [here](https://uppmax.github.io/HPC-python/extra/isolated_deeper.html)
  and is made by Björn
- Is this really it? It is part of the 'Extra' material, I guess it can/should
  be moved

## Meeting Björn 2025-02-19 ~13:00

Goals:

- To find out how to do co-teaching

Questions:

- What are our personal goals of co-teaching?
- How do we define good co-teaching?
- How do we think good co-teaching looks like?
- How do we prepare our lessons together?

Discuss questions from `[Cook & Friend, 1995]`:

> 1. To what extent am I willing to let someone else carry out
> teaching tasks at which I am particularly skilled?

- B:
- R: I can when (1) we agree on the learning outcomes, and (2) there is some
  from of evaluation (i.e. the other can learn from his/her potential
  mistake)

> 2. How willing am I to allow a colleague to see aspects of my
> teaching in which I am not particularly skilled?

- B:
- R: perfectly fine

> 3. To what degree do I believe that there is more than one right
> way to carry out almost any teaching/learning task? 

- B:
- R: I believe that and am interested to find out other ways

> 4. How willing am I to tell a colleague when I disagree about an
> issue or have a concern?

- B:
- R: I am willing to do so


And `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> Are you flexible or able to compromise your beliefs? 
> Which one(s) will you not compromise?

- R: I can compromise on any beliefs based on evidence
  from the academic literature

> What skills can you contribute to the co-teaching team that will allow you to
> be successful?

- R: planning, openness, directness, aware of of the literature, preparedness

> How often should co-teachers reflect on their practice? What are some ways
> reflection contributes to the co-teaching partnership?

- R: For these two hours, one/more questions on an evaluation form are
  good enough. I'd enjoy to read a reflection from the other teacher

> How can co-teachers reconcile differences in personal planning styles?

- R: I can be flexible and prepare from way-ahead-of-time to last-minute:
  I just need to know

## What is effective co-teaching?

Approaches to Co-Teaching, from `[Cook & Friend, 1995]`:

![Cook & Friend, 1995, figure 1](cook_and_friend_1995_fig.png)

From `[Cook & Friend, 1995]`:

> [...] A first step for most co-teachers is to examine carefully their
> own readiness for the professional and personal demands of
> co-teaching [...]:
>
> - 1. To what extent am I willing to let someone else carry out
>   teaching tasks at which I am particularly skilled?
> - 2. How willing am I to allow a colleague to see aspects of my
>   teaching in which I am not particularly skilled?
> - 3. To what degree do I believe that there is more than one right
>   way to carry out almost any teaching/learning task? 
> - 4. How willing am I to tell a colleague when I disagree about an
>   issue or have a concern?

From `[Cook & Friend, 1995]`, Table 1, 'Questions for Creating a Collaborative
Working Relationship in Co-Teaching':

From `[Sharon, 2014]`:

> - Achieving effective co-teaching relationships is a complex process'
> - Obtaining external dimensions is not enough for effective co-teaching partnerships
> - Teachers can use individual differences as strengths to overcome challenges
> - Compatibility can be achieved through being similar or complementary
> - In an effective co-teaching state, teachers are interdependent of each other

Ironic, the Magiera-Simmons quality indicator model of co-teaching
is not in the academic literature and the website it was at, has moved.
However, I can find these in `[Simmons & Magiera, 2007]`:

- QI 8 Both Teachers Are Clearly Responsible For Group Instruction
- QI 11 Accommodations For Students With Disabilities Are Observed In The Classroom
- QI 14 Both Teachers Provide Substantial Instruction To All Students
- QI 17 The Process of Learning Is Emphasized Along With The Content Being Learned

From `[Peery, 2019]`, the four pillars of a good co-teaching relationship:

- Respect
- Communication
- Flexibility
- Humor

From  `[Conderman et al., 2008]`:

> In our co-teaching partnership:
>
> 1. We decide which co-teaching model we are going to use based on the benefits to students and co-teachers
> 2. We share ideas, information, and materials
> 3. We identify the resources and talents of the co-teachers
> 4. We teach different groups of students at the same time
> 5. We are aware of what our co-teacher(s) is doing even when we are not directly in his or her presence
> 6. We share responsibility for deciding what to teach
> 7. We agree on the curriculum standards that will be addressed in a lesson
> 8. We share responsibility for deciding how to teach
> 9. We share responsibility for deciding who teaches parts of the lesson
> 10. We are flexible and make changes, as needed, during a lesson
> 11. We identify student strengths and needs
> 12. We share responsibility for differentiating instruction
> 13. We include others when their expertise or experience is needed
> 14. We share responsibility for how student learning is assessed
> 15. We can show that students are learning when we co-teach
> 16. We agree on discipline procedures and implement them together
> 17. We provide feedback to each other on what goes on in the classroom
> 18. We improve our lessons based on what happens in the classroom
> 19. We freely communicate our concerns
> 20. We have a process for resolving disagreements which we use when faced with challenges and conflicts
> 21. We celebrate the process, outcomes, and successes of co-teaching
> 22. We have fun with each other and the students when we co-teach
> 23. We have regularly scheduled times to meet and discuss our work
> 24. We use our meeting time productively
> 25. We effectively co-teach even without common planning time
> 26. We explain co-teaching benefits to students and their families
> 27. We model collaboration and teamwork for our students
> 28. We are both viewed by our students as their teacher
> 29. We include students in the co-teaching role

From `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> WaltherThomas (1996) found five common themes that emerged from her research into
> how successful co-teachers use their planning time:
>
> - `1`. Successful co-teachers trust their partners and rely on their partner’s
>   strengths and contributions to facilitate the planning process. 
>   These coteaching partnerships have confidence in each other and delegate
>   responsibilities, knowing that the work will be done.
> - `2`. Successful co-teachers use structured learning environments to help them
>   use their strengths. They use a mix of direct instruction, guided practice,
>   and individual work with teacher assistance in order to support the needs of
>   all learners and ensure both co-teachers are equally involved and valued in
>   the delivering the lesson. Having a structured learning environment to plan
>   for also allows them to focus their planning time on specific types of
>   activities.
> - `3`. Successful co-teachers ensure that both partners’ contributions are valued,
>   both during planning time and during the lesson. There is parity at all
>   levels, effectively erasing the distinction between the general education
>   teacher and the special education teacher.
> - `4`. Successful co-teachers create routines to facilitate their planning. By using
>   their knowledge of each other’s skills, strengths, and styles, in conjunction
>   with planning routines and templates using their limited co-planning time
>   well.
> - `5`. Successful co-teachers become more skilled over time. By combining the
>   qualities listed above and through practice, they find their co-planning time
>   becomes more productive, comfortable and creative as they work at it.


About co-teaching planning templates, from `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> [...] many co-teachers use planning templates [...]. While
> the format of these planning templates varies, they consistently include:
> - Identification of which co-teaching model(s) will be used. This ensures that
>   co-teachers are constantly thinking about how they can use their strengths
>   and the strengths of the various co-teaching models to best meet the needs
>   of their students.
> - Identification of the accommodations and modifications students in the class
>   are eligible for. This ensures that co-teachers can plan activities that take
>   classroom accommodations into consideration. In addition, it ensures that
>   any necessary classroom modifications, for instance in content expectations,
>   are appropriately co-planned for.
> - Identification of the specific teacher roles. This ensures that both teacher’s
>   strengths and skills are taken into account during planning and used in class.
>   By ensuring that both teachers have a specified, active role in the class,
>   coteachers communicate mutual respect and collaboration.

Reflection for co-teachers, from `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

- Do I feel we are jointly planning, both long term and short term?
- Do I believe that I am an equal partner in the decisions that are made?
- Do I feel we have a sense of interdependence?
- Do I feel we are continually learning from each other?
- Do I feel we have clearly defined roles and responsibilities?
- Am I satisfied with our roles and responsibilities?
- Am I learning as a result of our roles and responsibilities?
- Do I feel that information and materials are freely shared?
- Do I feel we communicate effectively?
- Do we regularly reflect on and evaluate our practice?
- Have we discussed various sound, research-based co-teaching models?
- Are we using mutually designed planning tools?
- Do I feel that my knowledge and skills are valued?
- Do I feel I am frequently acknowledged and reinforced by my partner?
- Do I feel my time is used productively when I am in the classroom?
- Can I easily read the nonverbal cues of my partner?
- Do both teachers move freely about the space in the co-taught classroom?
- Do we both often present lessons in the class?
- Are many measures used for grading students?
- Is humor often used in the classroom?
- Are modifications of goals for students with special needs fully incorporated into this class?
- Do we use a variety of classroom management techniques to enhance the learning of all students?
- Am I confident in my partner’s knowledge of the curriculum content?
- Is time allotted or found for common planning?
- Do students accept both teachers as equal partners in the learning process?
- Is behavior management the shared responsibility of both teachers?
- Are grading and other external responsibilities equally shared?

From `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> A template by DeBoer and Fister (1995) asks the teacher to review each of the
> following points to determine if the team is doing all that they can to encourage
> students to think deeply, critically and reflectively in the relevant subject area.
>
> - `1`. Do we ensure that students process information by allowing students to
>   ‘chew on’ the information that is presented so that it makes sense to them
>   and they can see its application to life?
> - `2`. Do we model thinking processes such as problem-solving and
>   decisionmaking by thinking aloud and how we revise our thinking when we have
>   made an error?
> - `3`. Do we ask broad, open-ended questions more frequently
>   than we ask factlevel or yes/no questions?
> - `4`. Do we follow up student responses by probing
>   and asking for clarification,
>   elaboration, evidence, and justification?
> - `5`. Do we have students ask questions of each other and themselves,
>    and make
>   them aware of the different levels of cognition 
>   (from fact-level to higherorder questions)?
> - `6`. Do we wait before calling on students so that they have time to fully
>   process the question and formulate their response?
> - `7`. Do we have a clear, instructional purpose and accomplish it by 
>   planning a sequence of activities that promote active involvement
>   with the content, as
>   well as with peers?
> - `8`. Do we increase metacognition by making students conscious of their own
>   thinking processes?

From `[Hepner & Newman, 2010]`:

> As teachers work to develop a co-teaching relationship, it is important to
> consider the following questions:
>
> - Are you flexible or able to compromise your beliefs? 
>   Which one(s) will you not compromise?
> - What skills can you contribute to the co-teaching team that will allow you to
>   be successful?
> - How often should co-teachers reflect on their practice? What are some ways
>   reflection contributes to the co-teaching partnership?
> - How can co-teachers reconcile differences in personal planning styles?

From `[Brendle et al, 2017]`:

> The co-teachers’ willingness to share the classroom and instructional responsibilities is
> key to a positive relationship

From `[Brendle et al, 2017]`:

> The success of a co-teaching partnership is based on the co-teachers’ understanding
> and expertise in implementing research-based co-teaching models .

From `[Chapple, 2009]`:

> If co-teachers were not of the
> same philosophical beliefs -that is, that all children can learn and that inclusion is
> essential for co-teaching to be successful- then the practice of co-teaching would not be
> effective. 

From `[Walther-Thomas et al., 1996]`, to discuss at a first meeting:

> - `1`. What are your expectations for students regarding: Participation? Daily preparation? Written assignments and/or homework completion?
> - `2`. What are your basic classroom rules? What are the consequences?
> - `3`. Typically, how are students grouped for instruction in your classroom?
> - `4`. What instructional methods do you like to use (e.g., lectures, class discussions)?
> - `5`. What practice activities do you like to use (e.g., cooperative learning groups? labs?)
> - `6`. How do you monitor and evaluate student progress?
> - `7`. Describe your typical tests and quizzes.
> - `8`. Describe other typical projects and assignments.
> - `9`. Do you differentiate instruction for students with special needs? If so, how?
> - `10`. Is any special assistance given to students with disabilities during class? On written assignments? On quizzes and tests?
> - `11`. How and when do you communicate with families?
> - `12`. What are your strengths as a teacher? What are your weaknesses? Pet peeves?
> - `13`. What do you see are our potential roles and responsibilities as co-teachers?
> - `14`. If we decide to co-teach together, what are your biggest hopes for our work as a team? What are your biggest concerns?

## 2025-04-15

The time is getting to close to do proper co-teaching. I have a meeting
with BC today. This will be my meeting schedule:

- Agree that there is not enough time.
  Suggest to continue co-teaching next iteration
    - [AGREED]
- Double-check schedule together: I think it is good now
    - [AGREED] on new schedule
- Split up Day 2 (RB is fine with either):
  - BC both hours
  - RB both hours
  - BC first hour, RB second
  - [AGREED] RB first hour, BC second
- Suggest to collaborate with issues, because in the material
  we've put todo's to someone's name
  - [AGREED] We'll use issues, until we feel the reply takes too long

## 2025-04-16

All my course material is in, only need to test these by making videos.

## 2025-04-25

Course material is just now done (at 7:35 in the morning).

I am worried about the tarball exercise: I estimate this to take some time,
time that I don't have.
