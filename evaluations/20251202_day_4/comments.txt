The material is good, but the teaching technique is lacking. Richel started off very good with a lot of interaction, breakout rooms and time for questions and doing things yourself. I liked this and that the exercises were part of the teaching, not meant to do during breaks, then you would never get breaks. I and some other seemed to be lost already at ondemand, and interactive work. So maybe you should make that session more interactive. Then it would have been easier to follow the other sessions after that.
