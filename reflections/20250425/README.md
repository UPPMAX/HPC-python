## Other feedback

From the Zoom chat:

> Thanks organising this Richel! Great sessions, and loved the energy.
> The extensive evaluation was from me, as you probably already knew.
> You did such a great work organising the first day,
> and it really shows how dedicated you are at teaching
> and making the sessions student-focused.
> I find it hard to improve when my students give me vague feedback,
> so I thought to pass my 5-cents a bit more constructively in the evaluation.
> Again warm thanks for your great work, it really helped!

I replied:

> Wow, so you were the Super Student! Thanks so much! 
> 
> And thanks for your compliment! There were some flaws, that you can already find in (the draft of) my reflection...
> 
> If you want to discuss teaching, I am always up to it! After the course of course :-)

After which we exchanged emails to talk about teaching.
