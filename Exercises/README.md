# Info about the exercise and demo dir

To get the materials: 

1. Easiest. Just clone the repo ``git clone https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python.git``. The ``Exercises/examples`` directory is below the ``HPC-python`` directory that is created when you clone the repo. 

2. Otherwise, fetch the tarball from the project directory (during the course) and extract it with "tar xzvf Exercises.tar.gz"
   - UPPMAX: Copy the file ``/proj/hpc-python/Exercises.tar.gz`` to your own project storage directory below ``/proj/hpc-python``. 
   - HPC2N: Copy the file ``/proj/nobackup/python-hpc/Exercises.tar.gz`` to your own storage directory below ``/proj/nobackup/ipython-hpc``.

The directories below "Exercises/dayN" contains the following directories:

- programs: Python codes, mainly, as well as a few Fortran and Julia codes
- hpc2n, uppmax, cosmos, nsc, pdc, c3se: Batch scripts that can run on (one of) the clusters at the center in questions, when you have edited the MYPATH variable inside (since the Python scripts recides in the programs directory)
