This course aims to give a brief, but comprehensive introduction to using Python in an HPC environment. You will learn how to use modules to load Python, how to find site installed Python packages, as well as how to install packages yourself. In addition, you will learn how to use virtual environments, write a batch script for running Python, use Python in parallel, and how to use Python for ML and on GPU:s. 

The course is a cooperation between UPPMAX (Rackham, Snowy, Bianca), LUNARC (Cosmos), and HPC2N (Kebnekaise) and will focus on the compute systems at all 3 centres. For the site-specific part of the course you will be divided into groups depending on which center you will be running your code, as the approach is somewhat different.
