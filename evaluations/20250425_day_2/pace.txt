the pacing was good. I really liked the course material.
Fast on the second day
great
I think it was good, I could keep up and take notes during all of the lectures.
I feel like it was a bit rushed, good content but a bit too much given the amount of time maybe?
It was a lot of information to take in. However the resources provided are sufficient to catch up if we were stuck anywhere.
Good
It was the right pace
I did not feel comfortable during the afternoon session was running too fast, just to adjust to the schedule and got few from that and was confused because of several concepts in a bunch without explain the practical examples I guess it is been assumed that everybody knows all the concepts.
Too fast to combine explanations and exercises
Good pace considering the amount of materials and time. Then one needs to practise home by rewatching the YT videos
Inconsistent - seemed slow much of the time, while some parts passed by before they could be properly explained or understood: it seemed to me that the time was not spent on the right things. I know enough about Python, I do not know enough about the software module system and SLURM and any other HPC-specific stuff.
Too fast
okish
Suitable
